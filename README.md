# 📑Algorithm & Problem Solving Repo📑

# 🎯Goals🎯

- To improve `PS Capabilities`
- To improve understanding of `Algorithm`
- To systematically mange `Algorithm & Problems`


# How to proceed
- prefix rules
    -  {platform abbreviation}_{problem identifiable number} 

## Below Rules is related to previous studies.

## ⌚How it goes

- At least 2 Problems each on **`Mon`**, **`Tus`**, **`Wed`**, **`Thu`**
- Learning based on `이것이 취업을 위한 코딩 테스트다 with Python`
- PS is based on `Baekjoon OJ` and `Programmers`
- Problems will be solved by `Python`
- Version `3.11.5`

## 📄Upload Convention

- Algorithm Study Name: `Algo/{Algorithm}`
- PS File Name: `PS/{OJ_PName_Algorithm}`
- If the number of problems to be solved increases, divided by algorithm.
- `YY/MM/DD` is the only way for Commit message
